# ⏰ Lab Shifts

### First Week

The first week for each RA should be devoted to the following:

1. Ensuring RAs understand the content of this manual and general lab practices, including confirming that CITI training, Human Resources paperwork, and the hiring process have all been done
2. Training on the protocol for any ongoing or upcoming studies
3. Training on all the security and data management works in the lab
4. Testing tasks to ensure they work as intended and that the variables are recording correctly

### Supervisor

The graduate student or other senior lab personnel listed on the schedule for your corresponding time slot is considered your supervisor and is responsible for:

1. Ensuring RAs arrive when their shift begins and leave when it ends
2. Making sure the study protocol is being followed
3. Monitoring the progress of the study
4. Delegating tasks and duties to RAs
5. Filling in for RAs in the running or control room as needed
6. Assisting RAs with any aspect of the study procedures
7. Ensuring that breaks are taken for all qualifying shifts, and that they are taken at a reasonable time

### Absense & Tardiness

If you must miss a shift for a non-emergency reason, the lab manager or a graduate student needs to know **as soon as possible**, preferably with at least a day’s notice. You also need to try to find someone to cover your shift and give them reasonably advanced notice.

Missing shifts for class-related things (writing a paper, studying for a test, too much homework, etc.) is frowned upon. If this becomes a recurring issue, your hours will be reduced, or you may be replaced.

Emergencies come up. Let the lab manager or a graduate student know if something is going on and you need to miss on short notice. We reserve the right to ask for documentation and, if this becomes a common occurrence, we will do so.

It is important to be on time. You will often be relieving someone else or coming in just as the lab opens/participants start showing up; if your shift starts at 10:00am be **in the lab** at 10:00am. Occasionally an RA is scheduled to come in right after a class or your shift ends right before the start of another class. We try to schedule shifts to avoid such instances, but this is not always possible. If that is your situation, let the lab manager or supervising graduate student know in advance, and you will be fine to leave a few minutes early or come in a few minutes late without penalty. **Other than that, tardiness (being even a minute late) will not be tolerated.** Again, if there is a legitimate reason that you are habitually late, just come talk to someone about it.

### RA Assignments

There are two main roles that RAs perform on their shift: the "runner" and the "controller".

The "runner" is the one that sits in the running room to administer the tasks and take any notes in the electronic running room lab notebook.

The "controller" is the one that sits in the control room to monitor emails, schedule participants, welcome participants on arrival and obtain informed consent, maintain the subject database, and more.

It is up the RAs working the current shift to determine who does what role. In general, it is a good idea to get experience in both roles over the course of your time in the lab.
