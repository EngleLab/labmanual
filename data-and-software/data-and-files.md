# ðŸ—ƒ Data and Files

### Storage Locations

We use Microsoft SharePoint to store and sync most of our files. However, we also store files on Dropbox, a Georgia Tech Z: drive server, and backup hard drives in the lab.

#### SharePoint

SharePoint functions just like Google Drive (e.g., Google Docs, Sheets, etc.) but more Microsoft documents (e.g., Word, Excel, ect.).&#x20;

Although SharePoint is synced locally on the control room computers (through OneDrive), it is highly advised to access files on SharePoint in the browser when on the control room computers. This ensures that you are accessing the most recent version of documents and to avoid any syncing issues between computers.

We have created SharePoint "Pages" to easily access frequently used documents for our ongoing projects in the lab.&#x20;

Our main SharePoint page is for the Control Room and can be accessed [here](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/sites/cos/psychology/engle-lab/SitePages/Control-Room.aspx)
