# General Responsibilities

### General responsibilities

Undergraduate research assistants (RAs) are the backbone of the lab and do much of the work that keeps data collection running smoothly. Responsibilities are primarily to recruit, schedule, remind, test, and pay participants. RAs also assist graduate students with research-related things like data entry, rudimentary data analysis, and proofreading documents/manuscripts. Other responsibilities include keeping the common areas of the lab clean and organized and managing our subject database. The bulk of the work can be done in the running and control rooms of the lab. However, occasionally on- and even off-campus recruitment may be necessary. More detailed responsibilities can be found in Section III.
